# Loan Eligibility Data Analysis Project
## Overview
This project revolves around the concept of data analysis and aims to provide insights into loan eligibility based on historical data. The analysis utilizes various machine learning techniques to understand the factors influencing loan approval decisions.

## Libraries Used
- numpy and pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization.
- re for regular expression operations.
- scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation.
- DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier for classification tasks.
- LogisticRegression for logistic regression modeling.
- train_test_split for splitting the dataset.
- accuracy_score and confusion_matrix for model evaluation.

## Data Analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the dataset.
- Visualizations using seaborn and matplotlib aid in uncovering patterns and trends.
- Machine learning models are used for predictive analysis of loan eligibility.
